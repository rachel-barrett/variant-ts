X Make variant and churchVariant interchangeable by adding match and caseOf functions to churchVariant. Can't as churchVariant doesn't work with caseOfWithDefault
Documentation on how to create a case with a void type.
Add neater inline documentation like on fp-ts
Deprecate and rename to variant-ts
