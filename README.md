This is helper library for constructing arbitrary variant types (aka sum types / discriminated unions) in typescript.

This code would make sense as part of the fp-ts library.

# publishing library locally

Use `npm link`

This only needs to be run once in the root of this directory.

Then run `npm link variant-ts` in the target directory.

# publishing library to npm
